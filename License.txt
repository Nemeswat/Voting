This is a repository for voting software built using Choice Coin on the Algorand Network. Our voting software is centered around Decentralized Decisions, an open-source voting software that allows organizations to make decisions in a distributed manner. The votes in Decentralized Decisions are recorded on the Algorand Blockchain and are tabulated using a stateless smart contract. Post-quantum cryptography ensures that voter information is kept secure throughout the entire process at all points of vulnerability. This repository is meant to facilitate open-development on the Choice Coin Platform and to serve as a starting point for developers looking to set up their own decentralized voting network. Development here can directly be used for Choice Coin's Developer Awards Program. Developers should follow the instructions below to get started. We are looking forward to seeing all the great innovations that will come out of our community!
